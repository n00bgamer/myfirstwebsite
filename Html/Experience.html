          <strong>Exploring the World of Networking: My Time at Sky Broadband</strong><br>

          When I joined Sky Broadband on May 1st, 2023, I didn't realize the incredible journey that awaited me. For five months, I was immersed in a world of networking and technology that reshaped my understanding.<br>

          At the start, I dove into router and switch configuration, learning the ins and outs of setting up networks. With the help of experienced mentors, I grasped concepts like routing protocols and VLAN configurations, each step painting a clearer picture of how our digital world connects.<br>

          But it wasn't just about technical stuff. I also learned about monitoring networks, using advanced tools to keep everything running smoothly for thousands of users. It was like deciphering a secret language, finding and fixing issues to ensure seamless connectivity.<br>

          One of the highlights was seeing PODs, the nerve centers of Sky Broadband's network. These unassuming structures quietly managed data flow across vast distances, showcasing the efficiency of modern networking.<br>

          The peak of my experience was visiting the <a class="links" href="https://datahub.com.np/">DataHub</a>. Among humming servers and blinking lights, I marveled at the sheer power behind our online world. Massive server racks housed the digital essence of countless entities, a testament to human innovation.<br>

          Leaving Sky Broadband, I carry not just technical skills but a deep appreciation for how networks shape our lives. It was more than a learning experience; it was a journey into the heart of the digital age. And as I move forward, I'm grateful for the lessons learned in the halls of Sky Broadband.
